/**
 * JSON-LD blocks, one per thing they describe.
 *
 * These used to all live in the root layout, which meant every route - /privacy,
 * /terms, every docs page - claimed to be a SoftwareApplication AND an FAQPage.
 * Structured data is supposed to describe the page it is on, so each block is
 * now mounted only where its content actually is:
 *
 *   Organization         root layout (site-wide identity, correct everywhere)
 *   SoftwareApplication  the home page, which is the page about the app
 *   FAQPage              /faq, the page that renders the full question list
 *
 * Everything asserted here must be true of the page it sits on and visible to a
 * reader of that page. Markup that contradicts the page - invented ratings,
 * prices that don't match the ones rendered, platforms with no build - is a
 * Search policy violation, and the penalty lands on the whole domain.

/**
 * The home page's SoftwareApplication block.
 *
 * Takes the live plans so `offers` describes the packs the page actually
 * renders. It used to hardcode lowPrice 20 / highPrice 500 / offerCount 3
 * against a price list fetched at request time, so the markup was free to
 * drift from the visible pricing - and structured data that contradicts the
 * page is a Search policy violation, not just a stale number.
 *
 * There is deliberately no `aggregateRating`. It used to claim 4.8 from 156
 * ratings while `src/config/testimonials.ts` is an empty array and no rating,
 * review or vote appears anywhere on the site. Google requires review markup to
 * reflect ratings genuinely visible on the page; inventing them risks a manual
 * action against the whole domain. That file's own comment already spells this
 * out - "fabricated testimonials on a page that also emits Product/Review
 * structured data are both a trust problem and a search-policy violation" - and
 * this block was the violation it was warning about. Restore it only when real
 * ratings are collected and shown, and derive it from that same data.
