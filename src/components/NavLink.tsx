 * That cost the URL in the status bar, middle-click and cmd-click, the ability
 * to copy or share the destination, and any chance of a crawler following it -
 * and left the address bar reading `/` after you'd scrolled to Features.
 *
 * Hash targets need no JavaScript here: `<Link href="/#features">` emits a real
 * `<a href="/#features">` and the browser scrolls to the id, smoothly, because
 * of the `scroll-behavior` and `scroll-margin-top` rules in styles/index.css.
