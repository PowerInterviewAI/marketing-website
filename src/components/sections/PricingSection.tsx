 * here, server-side, with no revalidate directive - which meant Next treated
 * /pricing as static and only paid that cost again on the first visit after
 * each deploy, freezing the page the same way TeamSection once froze /team.
 * Hardcoding removed the dependency entirely rather than just deferring it.
