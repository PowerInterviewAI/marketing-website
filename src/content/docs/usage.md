# Usage

This page describes how to use Power Interview during a live interview session, including transcription, AI suggestions, code assistance, face swap, stealth mode, and window management.

---

## Starting a Session

1. Launch Power Interview.
2. Review configuration and settings to ensure your profile is complete and devices are set up correctly.
3. Click the **Start** button to activate transcription and AI assistance.

Once started, the app begins capturing audio from your configured microphone (your voice) and the system audio loopback (the interviewer's voice). Both channels are streamed to the ASR backend in real time and displayed in the transcript panel.

To stop the session at any time, click **Stop** in the UI or press `Ctrl+Shift+Q` from any window (this also exits stealth mode if active).

## Transcription

### How It Works

- Your voice is captured through your selected physical microphone.
- The interviewer's voice is captured automatically via Windows system audio loopback (whatever is playing through your speakers from the video call). No additional device configuration is needed.
- Both streams are sent to the ASR backend over WebSocket and returned as live transcription.
- Each line is labeled by speaker name: your configured name or "Interviewer", with a timestamp.

## AI Reply Suggestions

Reply suggestions are generated based on the current transcript, your profile (name, CV), and the job context you configured.

### Getting a Suggestion

Suggestions are triggered automatically as the AI determines a response is useful, or you can request one manually through the UI. The suggestion streams into the reply panel word by word in real time.

### Scrolling Suggestions

You can use the keyboard to scroll through reply suggestion content without leaving your video call window (use J/K for line‑by‑line movement or L to jump to the end):

| Action        | Shortcut       |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| Scroll up     | `Ctrl+Shift+K` |
| Scroll down   | `Ctrl+Shift+J` |
| Scroll to end | `Ctrl+Shift+L` |

---

## AI Code Suggestions

For technical interviews with coding problems, Power Interview can analyze your screen and suggest solutions.

### Workflow

1. When a coding problem appears on screen (in your browser, IDE, or shared screen), press `Ctrl+Shift+F9` to take a screenshot. You can also skip the queue and automatically submit in one step by using `Ctrl+Shift+F12` (capture + submit).
2. You can capture up to **4 screenshots** to provide more context (e.g., multiple parts of the problem due overflowed content or different tabs).
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+F10` to submit the screenshots for analysis (not needed if you used F12).
4. The AI processes the images and streams a suggested solution with syntax-highlighted code into the code suggestion panel.
5. To clear the captured screenshots (e.g., mistakes), press `Ctrl+Shift+F11` to clear all captured screenshots.

### Scrolling Code Suggestions

You can also jump to the end of the code panel using the third shortcut (O).

| Action        | Shortcut       |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| Scroll up     | `Ctrl+Shift+I` |
| Scroll down   | `Ctrl+Shift+U` |
| Scroll to end | `Ctrl+Shift+O` |

## Face Swap

The face swap feature replaces your webcam output with a face-swapped stream - your physical appearance is replaced with the face from the photo you configured in settings.

### Setting It Up

1.  Ensure **OBS Studio** is installed before opening your video call.

2.  Ensure **VB-Audio Virtual Cable driver** is installed.

3.  In your video call app (Zoom, Google Meet, Teams, etc.), select:
    - **OBS Virtual Camera** as your camera source
    - **CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)** as your microphone

|                                              Camera                                              |                                           Microphone                                           |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| ![Select OBS Virtual Camera as camera in your meeting app](/media/docs/meeting-video-device.png) | ![Select CABLE Output as microphone in your meeting app](/media/docs/meeting-audio-device.png) |

4. In Power Interview, open **Face Swap Options** from the control panel (face scan icon), select your webcam and resolution, then close the dialog.

   ![Face Swap Options dialog](/media/docs/face-swap-options.png)

5. Toggle **Face Swap on** using the face icon button in the control panel.

   |                                   Face Swap ON                                    |                   Start assistant with face swap active                   |
   | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------: |
   | ![Face swap toggle button in the control panel](/media/docs/face-swap-toggle.png) | ![Start assistant with face swap active](/media/docs/face-swap-start.png) |

6. Click start button to begin the session with face swap active.

   ![Face swap in action — webcam feed replaced with face-swapped output](/media/docs/face-swap-example.png)

The VCam Agent captures frames from your webcam, streams them to the face swap backend, and pushes the processed output to OBS Virtual Camera.

### Face Swap Settings

| Setting          | Description                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Camera Device    | Physical webcam used as the video input            |
| Resolution       | Output resolution: 640×360, 640×480, or 1280×720   |
| Face Enhancement | Toggle AI post-processing for more natural results |

## Stealth Mode

The Power Interview window is **always hidden from screen capture and screen share** — interviewers cannot see it at any time, regardless of whether stealth mode is on or off.

Stealth mode is about **focus control**. When active, the window will not steal focus from your coding challenge, IDE, or video call. You stay in full control of your keyboard and mouse at all times.

### Activating Stealth Mode

Press `Ctrl+Shift+M` to toggle stealth mode on or off.

When active, the window collapses to a minimal status bar showing running state, credit balance, and active hotkeys.

![Stealth mode status bar](/media/docs/stealth-mode.png)

### Opacity Toggle

Press `Ctrl+Shift+N` to toggle a low-opacity overlay, letting you glance at suggestions through a semi-transparent window without switching focus away from your active window.

## Window Management

Because you cannot use the mouse to interact with Power Interview while focused on your interview, all window controls are available via keyboard shortcuts.

### Positioning the Window

Use a numpad-style layout to snap the window to any screen position:

### Fine-Tuning Position and Size

| Action        | Shortcut               |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Move window   | `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Arrow` |
| Resize window | `Ctrl+Win+Shift+Arrow` |
