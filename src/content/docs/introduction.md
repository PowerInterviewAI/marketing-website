# Introduction

Power Interview AI is a privacy-first AI interview coach that works in two stages: you rehearse against a spoken mock interview it runs itself, then it sits the real interview with you. It is a desktop application on your machine, combining an AI interviewer with a scored report, real-time transcription, intelligent AI suggestions, and smart meeting export for Google Meet, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and more - all designed to keep your data under your control.

## What It Does

**Before the interview**, it runs a mock one. An AI interviewer speaks its questions out loud, listens while you answer into your microphone, presses with a follow-up when an answer leaves something open, and hands back a scored report on every answer you gave - including a stronger version of each one.

**During the interview**, it listens to the conversation, transcribes it in real time, and surfaces contextual suggestions so you can respond with clarity. For technical roles, it can analyze coding problems on your screen and generate a solution. For behavioral rounds, it draws on your profile - your name, CV, and the job description - to generate personalized, natural-sounding responses.

Both stages read the same profile, so the questions you rehearse against and the answers you are prompted with are about the role you are actually interviewing for.

The model is provided for you - there is nothing to connect or configure. New accounts start on the free model for the first hour, and buying credits moves you to the SOTA model with no practical rate limit.

## Core Features

### Mock Interview

- A full practice interview inside the app: the AI interviewer **speaks its questions**, listens to your spoken answers, and scores them
- Choose a seniority (junior to staff), a difficulty and a length of 3, 5, 8 or 12 questions; the role comes from the job context already on your account
- Behavioural, technical, situational and closing questions, with up to two follow-ups on an answer that leaves something open
- Ends in a scored report: an overall score with strengths and gaps, then every question scored on its own with a justification and a stronger version of your answer, exportable to `.docx` or Markdown
- Runs in all 28 interview languages; where a language has no voice the interviewer writes its questions instead
- See the [Mock Interview](/docs/mock-interview) guide for the full walkthrough

### Real-Time Transcription

- **Dual-Channel**: Your microphone captures your voice; system audio loopback captures the interviewer automatically
- Streams transcription live via WebSocket with low latency
- Each line is labeled by speaker (your name or "Interviewer") with a timestamp
- Auto-scroll keeps up with new lines; a toggle lets you pause and scroll back
- Change your microphone **mid-interview** without stopping the session - the swap is instant, with no gap in the transcript and nothing to reconnect

### Interview Language

- **28 languages**, selectable from the control bar
- One setting drives all three: the speech model that transcribes the call, the language your suggestions come back in, and the language of your exported report
- Changeable **mid-interview** - suggestions follow immediately, transcription reconnects on the new language
- Arabic and Hebrew render right-to-left throughout, including mixed-script technical answers

### AI Reply Suggestions

- Generates interview answers personalized to your CV and job description
- Streams suggestions in real time as the conversation progresses
- Considers the full conversation context, not just the last question
- Produces human-like responses based on your profile
- Optional **Professional Mode** switches suggestions to short hints - a headline plus keyword bullets - instead of full sentences, for a quick glance mid-interview

### AI Code Suggestions

- Captures one or multiple screenshots of your screen (up to 4) to read the problem
- Sends the screenshots to an AI model that generates a suggested solution
- Displays the result with syntax highlighting inside the app
- All triggered without ever switching focus away from your interview window

### Stealth Mode

- The Power Interview AI window is **always hidden from screen capture and screen share** - interviewers can never see it regardless of mode
- Stealth mode keeps the window from receiving focus, so your keyboard and mouse stay locked on your coding challenge or video call
- A minimal status bar shows running state, credit balance, and active hotkeys
- A toggleable low-opacity overlay lets you glance at suggestions without switching focus
- Entire workflow controllable by keyboard shortcuts - no mouse required, no lost focus

### Smart Meeting Notes & Export

- After a meeting or interview session, export a complete AI-generated report as a Word document (`.docx`)
- Report includes a summary, timestamped transcript with speaker labels, action items, follow-up notes, and any reply suggestions
- Works across Google Meet, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and other meeting platforms, so you can capture notes for both individuals and enterprise workflows

### Credits & Payments

- Credits are consumed while the assistant is running (AI suggestions and transcription)
- A mock interview is priced per question, follow-up and report instead of by the minute, so think-time is free
- Credit balance is displayed live inside the app
- Buy credits directly from the **Buy Credits** page within the app, with payment history and status tracking

### Global Hotkeys

Every function in Power Interview AI is accessible from any window via keyboard shortcuts:

| Action                                      | Windows / Linux                 | macOS         |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Stop all & exit stealth                     | `Ctrl+Shift+Q`                  | `⌃⌥Q`         |
| Toggle stealth mode                         | `Ctrl+Shift+M`                  | `⌃⌥M`         |

| Toggle professional mode                    | `Ctrl+Shift+F7`                 | `⌃⌥F7`        |
| Place window (numpad layout)                | `Ctrl+Shift+1` – `Ctrl+Shift+9` | `⌃⌥1` – `⌃⌥9` |
| Move window                                 | `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Arrow`          | `⌃⌥⇧Arrow`    |
| Resize window                               | `Ctrl+Win+Shift+Arrow`          | `⌃⌥⌘Arrow`    |
| Zoom in/out or reset zoom                   | `Ctrl+Shift+[=, -, 0]`          | `⌃⌥[=, -, 0]` |
| Scroll live suggestions panel (down/up/end) | `Ctrl+Shift+[J, K, L]`          | `⌃⌥[J, K, L]` |
| Scroll triggered suggestions panel          | `Ctrl+Shift+[U, I, O]`          | `⌃⌥[U, I, O]` |
| Capture screen                              | `Ctrl+Shift+F9`                 | `⌃⌥F9`        |
| Clear captures                              | `Ctrl+Shift+F10`                | `⌃⌥F10`       |
| Trigger without captures                    | `Ctrl+Shift+F11`                | `⌃⌥F11`       |
| Trigger with captures                       | `Ctrl+Shift+F12`                | `⌃⌥F12`       |

On macOS the base modifier is **Control+Option** (`⌃⌥`) rather than `Ctrl+Shift`, because `Ctrl+Shift` combinations collide with system shortcuts there. `⇧` is Shift and `⌘` is Command.

## How It Is Built

Power Interview AI consists of three layers running together on your machine:

| Layer            | Technology                    | Purpose                                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Desktop UI       | Electron + React + TypeScript | User interface and configuration                |
| Desktop Runtime  | Electron                      | UI, local audio capture, and system integration |
| Backend Services | Cloud (separate)              | AI/LLM inference and ASR processing             |

The desktop client communicates with local services and with cloud services over secure channels. Transcripts and screenshots are sent to the backend only when you actively request a suggestion, and are not retained afterwards. Your interview configuration (full name, profile/CV, context) is stored with your account so it is available on every device you sign in to.

---

## Privacy at a Glance

- Your interview configuration (full name, profile/CV, and context) is saved to your account, so signing in on another device restores it
- Session tokens and device settings (audio device, window layout, scroll preferences) are stored on your machine by Electron Store, in your user profile folder
- Transcripts are not stored on external servers after a session ends

---

## What You Need

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- A Power Interview AI account (sign up from within the application)
- A Windows or macOS machine
- A working microphone and (optionally) webcam
