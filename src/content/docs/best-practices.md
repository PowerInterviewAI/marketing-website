# Best Practices

> **Be Careful:**
>
> Always start the Power Interview AI assistant **before** joining the call so transcription and suggestions are ready from the first question.
>
> Getting the most from Power Interview AI requires more than just turning it on. The following practices will help you achieve accurate transcription, relevant AI suggestions, and a seamless interview experience.
>
> Shortcuts below are written in their Windows and Linux form. On macOS the base modifier is **Control+Option** (`⌃⌥`) instead of `Ctrl+Shift`, so `Ctrl+Shift+M` is `⌃⌥M`. See the [complete hotkey reference](/docs/live-interview) for both columns side by side.

## Profile & Context Setup

### Write a Detailed CV / Profile

The quality of AI reply suggestions depends directly on the detail in your profile. A one-line summary produces generic answers. A thorough profile produces relevant, personalized ones.

**Do:**

- Include your job titles, years of experience, and key responsibilities
- List specific technologies, frameworks, and languages you know
- Mention notable projects with measurable outcomes
- Include soft skills and working preferences when relevant

**Avoid:**

- Pasting a raw PDF-extracted text with garbled formatting
- Leaving the profile field empty or with placeholder text

### Tailor the Context to Each Interview

The **Context** field (job description / role requirements) directly shapes the tone and subject matter of reply suggestions. Before each interview:

1. Click the menu icon (☰) in the titlebar and select **Configuration**.
2. Replace the previous job description with the one from the current role.
3. Highlight the key skills the role requires - the AI will weight those more heavily.

The more aligned your context is to the actual interview, the more targeted and useful the suggestions will be.

## Audio Setup

### Use a Dedicated Microphone

The built-in laptop microphone often picks up keyboard sounds, fan noise, and room echo, all of which reduce transcription accuracy. A USB headset or desktop microphone with noise cancellation produces significantly better results.

### How Interviewer Audio is Captured

Power Interview AI captures the interviewer's voice via system audio loopback - it reads whatever audio is playing through your system speakers automatically. No extra routing software is needed for transcription to work for both channels.

### Test Audio Before the Interview

Run a short test session a few minutes before the interview starts:

- Speak a few sentences and verify your voice appears in the transcript.
- Play a short audio clip through your speakers and verify the loopback channel picks it up.
- If the microphone channel is missing, re-check that your physical microphone is selected in **Audio Options**.

### A Dead Headset is Recoverable

If your microphone fails mid-interview, you do not have to stop the session to fix it. Open **Audio Options** and pick another device - the swap is instant, the transcript is unbroken, and your suggestion history stays where it is. If the replacement cannot be opened, the session stays on the device it already had rather than dropping to silence.

### Set the Interview Language Before You Start

Pick your language from the **language button** on the control panel as part of your setup, not once the interview is underway. It can be changed mid-session, but transcription has to reconnect on the new language, which costs a second or two and can orphan whatever was being said at that moment. Setting it up front avoids paying that during a question.

## Code Suggestion Workflow

### Capture Multiple Angles of the Problem

A single screenshot of a long problem statement often misses important details. Use up to four screenshots to cover:

- The full problem description
- Sample inputs and expected outputs
- Any relevant constraints or examples below the fold

Press `Ctrl+Shift+F9` for each capture, then `Ctrl+Shift+F11` to submit (use `Ctrl+Shift+F10` to clear captures if you make a mistake).

## Stealth Mode & Window Placement

The Power Interview AI window is always excluded from screen capture and screen share - interviewers cannot see it regardless of where it is placed or whether stealth mode is on.

### Set Up Your Window Position Before the Interview

Decide where the Power Interview AI window will sit on your screen before the interview begins. Use `Ctrl+Shift+1–9` to snap it to your preferred screen zone. The bottom-right or top-right corners are often least intrusive.

Position it so it is:

- Visible to you at a glance
- Not overlapping the content you need to look at (your IDE, the interviewer's video)

### Enable Stealth Mode During Coding Challenges

Turn on stealth mode (`Ctrl+Shift+M`) whenever you need to type or interact with your IDE without the Power Interview AI window accidentally capturing focus. This keeps your keystrokes going to the right place.

### Use a Dual-Monitor Setup

If you have two monitors, run your video call on one screen and Power Interview AI on the other for maximum comfort - the assistant is always on a separate display.

### Practice Hotkeys Beforehand

The hotkey shortcuts are the core interface during an interview. Practice them before your interview so they feel natural:

- Scroll through suggestions without looking at the keyboard
- Capture and submit a screenshot from memory
- Toggle stealth mode and opacity without hesitation

Any fumbling with shortcuts during an interview will be distracting and costly.

## Rehearse With a Mock Interview

The assistant is at its best when it is confirming an answer you were already going to give, not supplying one you have never said out loud. A [mock interview](/docs/mock-interview) is how you get there: it runs on the same profile and job context as the real session, so the questions are the ones the role will actually ask.

- **Run one against the same context you will interview with.** A mock session for the job description you just pasted in rehearses that role, not interviewing in general.
- **Run it at the seniority on the job ad, not the one you hold.** The gap between the two is the thing to practice.
- **Read the report before the checklist below.** Its gaps section is a list of what to prepare, written from what you actually said.
- **Keep live suggestions off the first time.** They show what the assistant would have answered, which is worth comparing against your own answer - but only after you have produced one.

## Pre-Interview Checklist

Before every interview, run through this checklist:

- [ ] Profile (name, CV) is up to date
- [ ] Context field has the correct job description for this role
- [ ] A mock interview has been run against that context, and its report read
- [ ] **Power Interview AI is started before joining the meeting**
- [ ] Microphone is selected and producing transcript output (test session run)
- [ ] Interview language is set to the language the interview will actually be conducted in
- [ ] Power Interview AI window is positioned and hotkeys tested

## Ethical Use

Use it responsibly:

- AI suggestions are a starting point - adapt them in your own words. Parroting a suggestion verbatim can appear unnatural.
- Ensure your use complies with the terms of service of the platform hosting the interview and with any applicable laws in your jurisdiction.
