# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev             # Start dev server at http://localhost:3000
pnpm build           # TypeScript check + Next.js production build
pnpm start           # Serve the production build locally
pnpm lint            # ESLint (strict, zero warnings allowed)
pnpm format          # Prettier format (auto-sorts imports + Tailwind classes)
pnpm format:check    # Check formatting without writing
```

Pre-commit hooks run Prettier + ESLint on staged TypeScript files automatically via Husky.

## Architecture

This is a **Next.js App Router marketing site** for Power Interview AI — no database, deployed to Vercel with normal server rendering. All routes live under `src/app/`.

### Routing & Pages

**`src/config/routes.ts` is the single source of truth for every internal destination.** `ROUTES` (page paths), `SECTIONS` (home-page anchor ids), `NAV_LINKS`, `SITEMAP_ROUTES` and `LEGACY_ANCHOR_REDIRECTS` all live there, and the header, footer, `sitemap.ts` and `next.config.ts` read from it. They each used to keep their own hand-written list and had already drifted — the footer pointed "Pricing" at a scroll target while the header pointed it at `/pricing`. Add a route in one place; don't reintroduce a second list.

File-based routing under `src/app/`:

- `src/app/page.tsx` — home route (`/`), a Server Component rendering `HomeContent`. Both are Server Components; the async data-fetching sections are rendered by the page and passed to `HomeContent` as already-resolved elements
- `src/app/how-it-works/`, `mock-interview/`, `pricing/`, `faq/`, `team/`, `privacy/`, `terms/` — standalone pages
- `src/app/docs/page.tsx` + `src/app/docs/[slug]/page.tsx` — docs listing and individual doc pages (Server Components, `generateStaticParams` prerenders all slugs)
- `src/app/not-found.tsx` — 404 for unmatched paths, rendered inside `PageChrome` so it still offers the full nav
- `src/app/sitemap.ts` / `src/app/robots.ts` — generated from `SITEMAP_ROUTES` + `src/lib/docs.ts`'s slug list, not hand-maintained

Every page except the docs (which have their own sidebar layout) uses `PageChrome` (`src/components/PageChrome.tsx`) for the Header/Footer.

### The routing rules

**1. Every navigation destination is a link.** `NavLink` (`src/components/NavLink.tsx`) always renders a `next/link`. Its predecessor, `SectionNavLink`, rendered a `<button>` calling `scrollIntoView` whenever the target was a section of the page you were already on — so the same nav item was a link on `/pricing` and not a link on `/`. That cost the URL in the status bar, middle-click and cmd-click, copy-link, crawlability, and left the address bar reading `/` after you'd scrolled to Features. **Never render a nav destination as a `<button>`.**

**2. The primary nav is routes only; anchors live in the footer.** `NAV_LINKS` is Home / How it works / Pricing / FAQ / Team / Docs — all real pages. Mock interview is a real page too and deliberately stays out of it, even though it now leads the home page: seven items is more than the bar fits at `md`, and the section is reached from the hero's secondary CTA, the head of the Features grid, the top of the footer's Product column and the docs. Add it to `NAV_LINKS` only alongside a nav that can hold it. Features, Why Us and Contact are still home-page sections, reached by scrolling and linked from the footer as `/#features` etc., which is conventional there and is a real, shareable URL. The bar used to mix the two with identical styling, which meant one nav with two behaviours and an active state that needed two rules to describe it (`pathname` for pages, a scroll-spy for anchors). Active state is now `pathname` alone — `useScrollSpy` is gone, along with the document-wide `MutationObserver` it ran.

**3. Hash scrolling is the browser's job.** `<Link href="/#features">` emits a real `<a>` and the browser scrolls to the id. `html { scroll-behavior: smooth }` and `:target { scroll-margin-top: 5rem }` in `src/styles/index.css`, plus `scroll-mt-20` on the `Section` variants, are what used to be a `scrollToSection` callback threaded from the page down through Header/Hero/FAQ/Footer — except that version also dropped every target behind the 4rem sticky header. **Don't reintroduce a `scrollToSection` prop.**

**4. A section with a page of its own renders in full in both places.** `HowItWorksSection`, `MockInterviewSection`, `PricingSection`, `FAQSection` and `TeamSection` each take a single `standalone` prop, and it only moves the heading from `h2` to `h1` so the route owns its own `h1`. There is no `preview` prop any more: the sections used to render a condensed version on the home page and link across to the full one, but the header nav points every one of those items at its home anchor (see `NAV_LINKS.section`), so a reader who clicked "Pricing" arrived at a summary of the page they had just asked for and had to click again. Don't reintroduce a `preview` prop. `next.config.ts` 308s the old `/features`, `/benefits`, `/why-choose` and `/contact` routes to home-page anchors; they were exact duplicates of the home sections and competed with the home page for ranking. A sitemap must never list a URL that 3xx's, so `SITEMAP_ROUTES` excludes them.

**5. An anchor target must be unique and must survive.** `PricingSkeleton` deliberately carries no `id`: it used to be `id="pricing"` as well, so the streamed HTML held two elements with that id and `/#pricing` resolved to the fallback, which is then thrown away.

**6. One label, one destination.** Every "Download" control uses `DownloadCta` (`src/components/DownloadCta.tsx`) and goes to `DOWNLOAD_HREF` (`/#install`). It replaced `GoHomeButton`/`useGoHome`, a `<button>` that pushed `/` from other pages and scrolled to the top of the home page — so a control labelled "Download Power Interview AI" offered no download, while the footer's "Download" link three columns away went to GitHub releases.

JSON-LD is scoped the same way (`src/lib/jsonLd.ts`): `Organization` is site-wide and stays in the root layout, `SoftwareApplication` is on the home page, `FAQPage` is on `/faq`. Structured data has to describe the page it sits on — all three used to be emitted on every route, including `/privacy` and every docs page.

### Documentation System

Markdown files live in `src/content/docs/`. `src/lib/docs.ts` reads them via Node `fs` (there's no `import.meta.glob` equivalent in Next.js) and holds the **single canonical `ORDER` array** used by both the docs index and the sidebar — don't add a second one. Adding a new doc: drop the `.md` file in `src/content/docs/` and add its slug to `ORDER` in `src/lib/docs.ts`.

The markdown render pipeline (`src/app/docs/[slug]/page.tsx`) uses `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` server-side; only the image renderer (`src/components/docs/MarkdownImage.tsx`) is a client component, since it's the only genuinely interactive piece (click-to-preview lightbox; `.mp4` sources render as a `<video>` with `controls` + `preload="metadata"` instead). Alt text doubles as the visible figure caption, so write a real description — obvious filler (`![Image](…)`) is detected and suppressed from the caption.

**Every doc surface must offer a route back to `/docs`.** The docs root is reachable from the sidebar's "All documentation" entry (`DocsSidebar`), the breadcrumb (`DocsBreadcrumb`), the foot-of-page pager (`DocsPager`, which also does prev/next from `getDocNeighbours`), and the docs-scoped 404 at `src/app/docs/[slug]/not-found.tsx`. Don't drop one without replacing it — a reader landing on a doc from search previously had no way to the index at all on mobile.

`.markdown-body` (github-markdown-css) is scoped to the `<article>` holding the rendered markdown, **not** to the whole content column. It restyles every `ol`/`ul`/`a` beneath it, which turned the breadcrumb into a numbered list and put bullets on the index cards. Keep page chrome outside it.

Demo videos live in `public/media/` (kebab-case, no tooling suffixes like `_compressed`); `public/media/docs/` holds the smaller screenshots/diagrams. Docs markdown references the shared clips in `public/media/` directly rather than keeping a second copy under `public/media/docs/`. Markdown can't carry `width`/`height`, so `src/lib/media.ts` reads each asset's intrinsic size off its file header at render time (PNG/JPEG/SVG) and stamps it on — that's what keeps screenshots from reflowing the prose as they decode. It also maps the embedded `.mp4`s to their posters; add an entry there for any new clip or it paints a black rectangle.

The six pending docs screenshots are still placeholders, generated by `node scripts/generate-placeholders.mjs`, which is the source of truth for their exact pixel sizes. `public/media/marketing/` is no longer placeholder art: the four hero posters are real frames cut from the demo clips and annotated by `python scripts/generate-posters.py` (needs ffmpeg + Pillow), and the testimonial avatar is a generated default avatar. Don't add the posters back to `generate-placeholders.mjs` — that would overwrite photographs with grid cards. Each folder's `README.md` has the details.

### Component Architecture

- `src/components/sections/` — the modular sections composing the Home page (Header, Hero, Features, Pricing, FAQ, Footer, etc.). Most are Server Components; only the genuinely interactive ones (`Header` for the mobile sheet, `InstallPanel` for the tabs and clipboard, the hero's `DownloadButton`/`ProductSurface`/`TrustStrip`) are `'use client'`. Removing the `scrollToSection` plumbing took the client boundary off the whole home page
- `src/components/ui/` — shadcn/ui base components (Button, Card) with `cva` variants
- `src/components/docs/` — `DocsLayout.tsx` + `DocsSidebar.tsx` for the docs section (client components; the doc slug list is resolved server-side in the page and passed down as a prop, since `fs` isn't available in a browser bundle)
- `cn()` utility in `src/lib/utils.ts` (clsx + tailwind-merge) — always use this for conditional classnames
- Always use `next/link`'s `Link` for internal navigation, never a raw `<a href="/...">` (a full page reload) and never a `<button>` with a scroll handler. `react-router-dom` isn't a dependency anymore
- Never nest a `<Button>` inside a `<Link>` — that renders a `<button>` inside an `<a>`. Use `<Button asChild><Link …/></Button>`

### The two things the product does, in order

The site sells a mock interview *and* a live assistant, and both are first-party features of the desktop app. **The mock interview comes first everywhere** - it is the half a reader can use the evening they download the app, without a scheduled interview to use it on, and the live assistant is what the rehearsal is for. Concretely, that ordering is carried by:

- `HomeContent` renders `MockInterviewSection` above `FeaturesSection` (it used to sit below it, reading as a footnote to the live assistant)
- `HowItWorksSection` is four steps, not three: install, add your CV and the job description, rehearse as a mock interview, then join the real call. The stealth hotkey callout hangs off the live step, which is now index 3
- `FeaturesSection` leads with the `mock` card. Note the bento constraint: a `wide` card spans two of three columns, so each is followed by exactly one narrow card - reorder them in pairs or you leave an empty cell
- `FAQ_ITEMS` leads its Product category with the mock question and its Plans & billing category with mock pricing (the credits answer cross-references it as "the question above")
- `ORDER` in `src/lib/docs.ts` puts `mock-interview` ahead of `live-interview`, and `public/llms.txt` matches
- Hero, `WhyChooseSection` and `BenefitsSection` copy all open on the rehearsal

Don't reorder any of those back without moving all of them: half the site leading with practice and half with the live call is how the copy drifted the first time. That is recent: `mock-interview.md` used to tell readers to open ChatGPT's voice mode and paste a prompt, because the app could not run a session itself, and the marketing copy still promised "AI-guided mock interviews" over the top of it. The workaround now survives only as the last section of that doc, for readers who would rather not spend credits.

Anything describing the mock interview has to match the client (`../client`), which is where the behaviour actually lives:

- Setup is seniority (junior/mid/senior/staff), difficulty (easy/standard/hard) and 3/5/8/12 questions. The role is **not** collected: it comes from the account's job context, and the same profile drives the questions and the scoring
- The interviewer speaks its questions, gates the microphone while it does, and can follow up **twice** on one question. A language with no voice makes it write them instead
- The session ends in a scored report: overall score, strengths, gaps, then per-question score, justification and a stronger answer, exportable as DOCX or Markdown
- Pricing is per unit of work, not per minute: 20 credits a question, 10 a follow-up, 40 for the report, and its transcription is unmetered (`app/cfg/payment.py` in `../backend`). Quote both halves whenever the site talks about credits, or the copy implies a mock session is metered by the clock

`CREDIT_RATES` in `src/lib/plans.ts` mirrors those rates for the components (the pricing section's metering note reads it, alongside the credit packs it already mirrored from the same backend file). Markdown can't import it, so `src/content/docs/mock-interview.md` restates the numbers and `src/config/faq.ts` restates them again for the JSON-LD; a rate change is those three places plus the backend.

### SEO / Metadata

Every route exports `metadata` (static pages) or `generateMetadata` (`/docs/[slug]`) via `src/lib/metadata.ts`'s `buildMetadata()`, which produces consistent title/description/canonical/OG/Twitter output. There's no `Seo.tsx` component; that pattern (a client `useEffect` mutating `document.title`) meant non-JS crawlers only ever saw the homepage's tags for every route.

- **Descriptions belong in the 120–160 character band.** Google truncates the snippet around there. Home used to run 566 characters, `/how-it-works` 262, `/pricing` 182 — everything past the cut is invisible and the sentence ends mid-clause.
- **The home page passes `absoluteTitle: true`** so its title is the brand-and-value line rather than `Home - Power Interview AI`. The most valuable title on the site was spending its first four characters on the word "Home".
- **Doc descriptions come from the doc.** `getDocDescription()` in `src/lib/docs.ts` reuses `getDocExcerpt()` to take the opening paragraph as plain text. They used to be `Documentation: ${title}` — 27–39 characters, identical in shape across all seven pages, which is a snippet Google discards.
- **Any page that 404s must be `noindex`.** Both `src/app/not-found.tsx` and `src/app/docs/[slug]/not-found.tsx` set it; without it they inherit the root layout's `index, follow`.
- **`sitemap.ts` never lists a URL that 3xx's**, and doc `lastModified` comes from the markdown file's mtime (`getDocLastModified`), not `new Date()` — a lastmod that moves for pages that didn't change is a signal crawlers learn to ignore.
- **`public/llms.txt` lists routes too.** It is not generated; update it when routes change. It had been advertising `/features`, `/benefits`, `/why-choose` and `/contact` as canonical URLs long after they became redirects.

**Structured data must be true of the page it sits on and visible to a reader of that page.** `src/lib/jsonLd.ts` scopes each block: `Organization` site-wide in the root layout, `SoftwareApplication` on the home page, `FAQPage` on `/faq`. All three used to be emitted on every route, including `/privacy` and every docs page.

- `buildSoftwareApplicationJsonLd(plans)` takes the live plans from `src/lib/plans.ts` so `offers` matches the packs the page renders. It used to hardcode lowPrice 20 / highPrice 500 against an endpoint actually returning 5–150 — wrong at both ends.
- **There is deliberately no `aggregateRating`.** It claimed 4.8 from 156 ratings while `src/config/testimonials.ts` is an empty array and no rating or review appears anywhere on the site. Google requires review markup to reflect ratings genuinely visible on the page; inventing them risks a manual action against the domain. Restore it only when real ratings are collected and shown, and derive it from that data — the same rule `testimonials.ts` already states for quotes.
- Don't claim a platform there's no build for (`operatingSystem` was `Windows, macOS, Linux`) or pass a logo off as a `screenshot`.

The root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`) holds the sitewide default metadata, `metadataBase`, the `Organization` JSON-LD, the anti-FOUC theme-init script, and Google Analytics via `next/script`.

### Model naming

Power Interview AI's own included/default models are referred to generically as **"free model"** (free-trial tier) and **"SOTA model"** (paid tier) throughout the site's copy — not by their actual underlying model name, which changes over time. Don't reintroduce a specific model name into marketing copy.

Bring-your-own-key was removed from the product, so the site no longer offers it anywhere: no "bring your own provider/key" copy, no LLM-vendor names (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Google) as a thing the user connects, and no BYOK entry in the pricing tables, comparison table, JSON-LD `featureList`, metadata keywords, `public/llms.txt`, or the docs. The model is always the provided one.

### Theme System

`src/hooks/useTheme.ts` manages light/dark/system theme via localStorage. It defaults to `'dark'` during the initial render (matching the root layout's anti-FOUC script) and only reads `localStorage` inside a `useEffect` — reading it in a `useState` lazy initializer crashes during server rendering, since client components are still rendered server-side for their initial HTML.

### Configuration

- `src/config/routes.ts` — every internal route, section id and redirect (see **Routing & Pages**). Imported by `next.config.ts` directly, so it must stay free of imports and contain nothing but plain data
- `src/config/constants.ts` — `APP_CONFIG`, `ENV` (reads `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` env vars and `process.env.NODE_ENV`)
- `src/types/index.ts` — shared types: `Status`, `ApiResponse<T>`, `User`, `Plan`, `Theme`
- Path alias `@/*` maps to `src/*` (configured in `tsconfig.json`)

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`. Variables must be prefixed `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to be exposed to client code, accessed via `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_*`.

### Styling

Tailwind CSS with custom HSL CSS variables for theming (defined in `src/styles/index.css`, imported globally in `src/app/layout.tsx`). Custom scrollbar and markdown prose styles are also in that file. Tailwind config in `tailwind.config.js` uses `darkMode: 'class'`.
